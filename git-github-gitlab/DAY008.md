## Git restore
The git restore command is used to undo changes in your working directory or staging area.

### 🛠️ Basic git restore Usage
1. Restore a file to the last committed version (undo local changes):
git restore <filename>
🔁 This discards unstaged changes and restores the file from the last commit.

1. Unstage a file (remove from staging area):
git restore --staged <filename>
🚫 This keeps your changes in the working directory but removes them from the staging area.

## Example
1. You made changes to a file but want to undo them:
`git restore index.js`
2. You accidentally staged a file:
`git restore --staged index.js`
