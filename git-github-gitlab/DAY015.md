# 🔄 Git Pull vs Git Fetch

Both `git pull` and `git fetch` are used to **update your local repository with changes from a remote repository**, but they behave differently.

---

## 📥 1. git fetch

```bash
git fetch
````

### ✅ What it does:

* **Downloads** commits, files, branches from the remote repo
* **Does NOT merge** or change your current working directory
* Allows you to **review changes** before applying them

### ✅ Example:

```bash
git fetch origin
```

Then check the new updates:

```bash
git log HEAD..origin/main
```

To apply changes manually after fetch:

```bash
git merge origin/main
```

---

## 🔁 2. git pull

```bash
git pull
```

### ✅ What it does:

* **Fetches + merges** the remote branch into your current branch in **one step**
* Changes your local working files if there are new updates

### ✅ Example:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

This will:

1. Fetch the latest changes from `origin/main`
2. Merge them into your current branch

## 🔧 Common Use Cases

### 🧪 If you want to **check updates** without affecting files:

```bash
git fetch
git diff origin/main
```

### 🚀 If you want to **quickly update your local branch**:

```bash
git pull
```

---

## 💥 Potential Conflicts

* `git pull` might cause **merge conflicts** if your local changes clash with remote changes.
* `git fetch` gives you time to **inspect** before merging.

## ✅ Summary Table

| Task                             | Command                          |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Fetch remote updates only        | `git fetch`                      |
| Fetch + merge remote updates     | `git pull`                       |
| Pull a specific branch           | `git pull origin <branch>`       |
| Merge after fetching             | `git merge origin/<branch>`      |
| Compare local and fetched branch | `git diff HEAD..origin/<branch>` |

## 🧠 Pro Tip

You can configure Git to always rebase when pulling:

```bash
git config --global pull.rebase true
```

This helps keep a **cleaner linear history**.
