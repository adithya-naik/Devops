Here's a `.md` format explanation for **`git diff`** command:

# 🧾 Git Diff Command – Complete Guide

`git diff` is used to show the differences between:

- Your **working directory** and the **staging area** (index)
- The **staging area** and the **last commit**
- Two **commits**, **branches**, or **files**

---

## 📌 Basic Usage

### 🔍 1. Show unstaged changes (working directory vs staging)

```bash
git diff
````

Shows what changes you have made that are **not yet staged**.

---

### 🗂 2. Show staged changes (staging vs last commit)

```bash
git diff --cached
# or
git diff --staged
```

Shows changes that are **staged** but **not yet committed**.

---

### 🔁 3. Compare two commits

```bash
git diff <commit1> <commit2>
```

Example:

```bash
git diff a1b2c3d e4f5g6h
```

Compares the differences between two specific commits.

---

### 🌿 4. Compare two branches

```bash
git diff branch1 branch2
```

Example:

```bash
git diff main dev
```

Shows the difference between `main` and `dev` branches.

---

### 📄 5. Compare specific files

```bash
git diff <file>
```

Example:

```bash
git diff App.js
```

Shows unstaged changes in `App.js`.

### 🧱 6. Compare file in last commit vs current version

git diff HEAD <file>
```

Shows changes made to a file compared to the last commit.
