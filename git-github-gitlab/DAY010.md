# Git Reset Explained

`git reset` is a powerful Git command used to **move the current branch pointer** to a specific commit. It can modify the **staging area** and **working directory** depending on the mode used.

## 🔧 Syntax

```bash
git reset [<mode>] <commit-hash>
```

## 🎯 Reset Modes

| Mode      | Commit History | Staging Area | Working Directory | Description |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| `--soft`  | ✅ Kept | ✅ Kept | ✅ Kept | Undoes commit while keeping changes staged |
| `--mixed` | ✅ Kept | ❌ Unstaged | ✅ Kept | Undoes commit, keeps changes but unstages them |
| `--hard`  | ❌ Rewritten | ❌ Cleared | ❌ Discarded | Permanently removes commit and changes |

## 📌 Common Examples

1. Undo last commit, keep changes staged:
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

2. Unstage files but keep changes:
```bash
git reset --mixed HEAD
```

3. Erase last commit and all changes:
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

⚠️ **Warning**: Use `--hard` with caution as it permanently deletes changes unless recovered using special tools.
