Here's a complete `.md` formatted explanation of the `git clone` command:

# 📥 Git Clone — Copy a Remote Repository to Your Local Machine

The `git clone` command is used to **download (clone) an existing Git repository** from a remote server (like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.) to your local system.

---

## 🔧 Basic Syntax

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
````

---

## ✅ Example

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
```

This will:

* Create a new folder named `repo-name`
* Download all the repo's files, branches, and commit history into that folder

---

## 📂 Cloning into a Specific Folder Name

```bash
git clone <repository-url> <folder-name>
```

### Example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git my-folder
```

This clones the repo into a folder called `my-folder` instead of `repo-name`.

---

## 🧠 What Does `git clone` Do Internally?

* Creates a `.git` directory in your local folder (this is the actual repo)
* Sets up a remote called `origin` pointing to the original URL
* Checks out the default branch (usually `main` or `master`)

---

## 🔄 Clone Using SSH (for private repos or push access)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:username/repo-name.git
```

> Note: You need to set up an SSH key for your GitHub/GitLab account.

---

## 🏗️ Clone with Submodules

If a project has **Git submodules**:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules <repo-url>
```

---

## 🔍 Clone a Specific Branch Only

```bash
git clone -b <branch-name> --single-branch <repo-url>
```

---

| Clone with SSH             | `git clone git@github.com:user/repo.git`     |
| Clone a specific branch    | `git clone -b dev --single-branch <url>`     |
| Clone with submodules      | `git clone --recurse-submodules <url>`       |

## 🧹 After Cloning

Once cloned, you can:

* Navigate into the project folder:

  ```bash
  cd repo-name
  ```
* View branches:

  ```bash
  git branch -a
  ```
* Pull updates:

  ```bash
  git pull
  ```

```
