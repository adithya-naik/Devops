# Git Stash Command
Here’s a complete explanation in `.md` (Markdown) format for the `git stash` command:

---


## 🧠 What is `git stash`?

`git stash` is used to **temporarily save changes** in your working directory that are not yet committed, so you can work on something else and come back to them later.

---

## ✨ Common Use Cases

- You’re working on something but need to switch branches without committing your current changes.
- You want to test or fix something quickly without losing your current progress.

---

## 📦 Basic Commands

### ✅ Save Current Changes

```bash
git stash
````

This stashes both tracked and staged files.

### ✅ Save with a Custom Message

```bash
git stash save "your message"
```

or in newer Git versions:

```bash
git stash push -m "your message"
```

### ✅ View Stashed Changes

```bash
git stash list
```

Shows a list of stashed items like:

```
stash@{0}: WIP on main: 13f2abc Fix bug
stash@{1}: On feature: work in progress
```

### ✅ Apply the Most Recent Stash

```bash
git stash apply
```

or a specific one:

```bash
git stash apply stash@{1}
```

### ✅ Apply and Delete the Stash

```bash
git stash pop
```

This is the same as `apply`, but it **removes** the stash after applying it.

### ✅ Delete a Specific Stash

```bash
git stash drop stash@{0}
```

### ✅ Delete All Stashes

```bash
git stash clear
```

## ⚠️ Notes

* **Untracked files** and **ignored files** are not stashed by default.
* To include untracked files:

```bash
git stash -u
```

* To include ignored files as well:

```bash
git stash -a
```

## 📌 Real-World Example

You're working on a feature, but your manager asks you to fix a bug on the `main` branch:

```bash
# Save your current work
git stash

# Switch to main
git checkout main

# Fix the bug and commit
# ...

# Switch back
git checkout feature

# Get back your work
git stash pop
```
