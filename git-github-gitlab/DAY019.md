## Skip staging area



To **skip the staging area in Git**, you can directly commit changes using the `-a` (or `--all`) flag with `git commit`. This stages **tracked** files automatically and commits them in one step.

---

### ✅ Skip Staging Area in Git

```bash
git commit -am "your commit message"
```

### 🔍 What It Does:

* Automatically stages **modified and deleted** files (that are already tracked).
* **Does NOT include new untracked files** — you must still run `git add` for them.

---

### 📝 Example

```bash
# You modified a tracked file (e.g., main.js)
git commit -am "Fix bug in main.js"
```

This commits the change **without running** `git add main.js`.

---

### ⚠️ Remember:

* This only works for **already tracked files**.
* For **new files**, you still need:

```bash
git add newfile.js
git commit -m "Add new file"
```
