# 🌿 Git Branches – Create, Switch, Merge, Delete

Branches in Git let you work on different versions of a project simultaneously. Here's how to manage them.

## 🔧 Creating Branches

### Create a New Branch
```bash
git branch <branch-name>
```
**Example:**
```bash
git branch feature/login
```
*This creates a new branch but doesn't switch to it.*

### Switch to a Branch
```bash
git switch <branch-name>    # New method
git checkout <branch-name>  # Old method
```

### Create and Switch in One Step
```bash
git switch -c <branch-name>    # New method
git checkout -b <branch-name>  # Old method
```

## 🔁 Managing Branches

### Merge a Branch
1. Switch to target branch (usually main):
```bash
git switch main
```
2. Perform merge:
```bash
git merge <branch-name>
```

### Delete Branches
**Local branch:**
```bash
git branch -d <branch-name>     # Safe delete
git branch -D <branch-name>     # Force delete
```

**Remote branch:**
```bash
git push origin --delete <branch-name>
```

### List Branches
```bash
git branch    # Local branches
git branch -r # Remote branches
git branch -a # All branches
```

## 📋 Quick Reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Create branch | `git branch <branch-name>` |
| Switch to branch | `git switch <branch-name>` |
| Create & switch | `git switch -c <branch-name>` |
| Merge branch | `git merge <branch-name>` |
| Delete local branch | `git branch -d <branch-name>` |
| Delete remote branch | `git push origin --delete <branch>` |

## 💡 Best Practices
- Always pull latest changes before merging: `git pull origin main`
- Resolve merge conflicts manually when they occur
- Don't delete unmerged branches unless certain
