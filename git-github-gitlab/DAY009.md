### ðŸ§­ What is git revert?
 1. The git revert command is used to undo a commit by creating a new commit that reverses the changes made in the original one â€” without altering your project history. (works evn if u havd pushed it to remote repo )

2. Itâ€™s safe for public branches because it doesnâ€™t change commit history like git reset.

âœ… Syntax:
git revert <commit-hash>
- Example:
  git revert 3f2a3e9
- Result:
  This will create a new commit that undoes the changes from commit 3f2a3e9.
